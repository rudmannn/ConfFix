# ConfFix

This repository contains the ConfFix tool, the evaluation detail and the benchmark of real-world configuration compatibility issues.

# ConfFix Dataset

Please find ```Section_3.xlsx``` for the detailed information of our empirical study in Section 3. 

The dataset for evaluating ConfFix contains 81 reproducible CC issues. Please check ```./evaluation/issue_in_the_latest_version.xlsx``` and ```./evaluation/issue_in_the_past.xlsx``` for the information of 81 CC issues, including the reproduction videos and our submitted pull requests and **issue reports** to the app developers. **We submitted patches for 39 successfully-repaired issues, of which 38 have been confirmed and merged by the app developers.** For the detail please check ```./evaluation/issue_in_the_latest_version.xlsx```.

The APK files and test cases of these 81 CC issues are provided [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnUUjcFFYAJEbPxHcm9MlkrX8zw?e=twSegT). Please put them inside the ```./source_code``` folder when you run the experiment.

We provide a  ```.sh``` file for each issue to help you reproduce the results of ConfFix (```conffix-exp-sh.rar```) and XFix (```xfix-exp-sh.rar```) . Put them in the root directory of ```./source_code``` to make them a try.

We also release the experimental results of ConfFix, XFix and Lint in ```./evaluation/Lint&ConfFix&XFix output.xlsx```. Besides, the raw outputs of ConfFix and XFix can be found in ```./evaluation/raw_outputs/``` folders.

# Build and Use ConfFix from Scratch

## Prerequisite

* UIAutomator2
* Python 3
* Android emulators at target API levels (e.g., API level 33)

## Steps

### 1. Create emulators

1. Download Android SDK Command line tools [link](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip) and unzip the .zip file.
2. Rename cmdline-tools to be tools and put it under an SDK root folder (e.g., `/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux`). So now the tools path will be `/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linu/tools`
3. Navigate to the SDK root and type in the following commands to install necessary files for the SDK

```
(1) tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux --install "system-images;android-33;google_apis;x86_64"
(2) tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux --install "platforms;android-33"
(3) tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux --install "platform-tools"
(4) tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux --install "emulator"
```

4. Add something into PATH

```
export ANDROID_HOME=/ssddata/SDK/android_sdk_linux
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export ANDROID_AVD_HOME=~/.android/avd
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_AVD_HOME
```

5. Create an folder under the SDK root named avds and create an Android emulator: `avdmanager create avd -n emulator0 -k "system-images;android-33;google_apis;x86_64" -p avds/emulator0`

6. Modify the emulator configuration to change the screen size of your emulator: In our evaluation, we set an emulator with 560dpi density. The density is set following the device profile of Google Pixel 6 Pro. To achieve this, modify the emulator configuration files (the file usually is: `./emulator0/config.ini`). Please change `hw.lcd.density=560`

7. Launch the emulators:

- Copy the essential files

```
cd /SDK/android_sdk_linux
mkdir android_sdk_linux && cd android_sdk_linux && mkdir system-images
cd /SDK/android_sdk_linux
cp system-images/* ./android_sdk_linux/system-images/ -r
```

- Launch the emulator

```
emulator @emulator0 -wipe-data -no-window -no-audio -memory 4096 -port 5554 -partition-size 8192 -skin 1440x3120 “android_sdk_linux/....”
```

This command launches the emulator `emulator0` in the port 5554. We set the device with 4GB RAM, 8GB disk, and 1440x3120 resolution. The resolution is set following the device profile of Google Pixel 6 Pro.

### 2. Run ConfFix

1. Install uiautomator2, which is used for executing test scripts
```
pip3 install --upgrade --pre uiautomator2
```

2. Add zipaligner and apksigner, which are used to sign the apk files generated by apktool. You can find zipaligner and apksigner in ```android_sdk/build-tools/[version_number]``` (the version number of the build tools you installed). For example, you may add the following environment variable.

```
export ANDROIDBUILDPATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/build-tools/31.0.0
export ANDROIDPLATFORMPATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools
```

3. To reproduce the experiment result, we have prepared a ```.sh``` file for each issue to run (```./source_code/conffix-exp-sh.zip``` and ```./source_code/xfix-exp-sh.zip```). For example, to try cwa_tan_input_digit_error, use the following command.
```
sh exp_cwa_tan_input_digit_error.sh emulator-5554 emulator-5556
```
where ```emulator-5554``` stands for the devices in the target API level, and ```emulator-5556``` stands for the devices in the issue-inducing API level.
ConfFix generates a patch as follows.
